# DiscordBot

Simple Discord bot, capable of basic moderation (banning and kicking members, announcements), along with utilizing the Riot Games API and TeemoJS (https://github.com/MingweiSamuel/TeemoJS) to create simple commands related to League of Legends. More functionality coming in the future.

The bot can also assign roles based on predetermined emojis on a role assignment message, and remove them if they deselect the emoji.
